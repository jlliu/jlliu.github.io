I constantly shift between and merge various media–the web, comics, user interface design, games, performance-as a way of experimenting with narratives and what new modes of relating can follow.\n\nIn parallel, I care about extending themes and methods in my practice as creative prompts for others. Previously, I've given talks, hosted workshops and classes, and written curriculum and zines about design and creative coding–with emphasis on moments for self-reflection, critical engagement, and creating from a place of healing and values alignment.\n\nI'm open to artistic collaborations, sharing my work in both online and IRL contexts, and giving talks and workshops. If any of this resonates with you, I'd love to get in touch!\n\n<br>\n\n<a href=\"mailto:hi@jackieis.online\" class=\"button\" data-v-e5183918=\"\"><i class=\"fa-solid fa-envelope\"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hi@jackieis.online</a>\n\n<br>\n\n### residencies\n- __[CultureHub Resident Artist](https://www.culturehub.org/ \"CultureHub website\")__, December 2023\n- __[NEW INC Year 9 Member - Art and Code Track](https://www.newinc.org/ \"NEW INC website\")__, September 2022 - June 2023\n\n### shows/exhibition\n- __[Chao Bing: A Reading/Writing](https://www.culturehub.org/chao-bing-a-reading-writing \"CultureHub website\")__, [Chao Bing](https://jackieisonline.itch.io/chaobing \"Chao Bing\") · live performance · December 2023\n- __[NEW INC Art & Code Group Show](https://www.demo2023.org/ \"DEMO2023 Website\")__, [Chao Bing](https://jackieisonline.itch.io/chaobing \"Chao Bing\") · interactive memoir game displayed in installation · June 2023\n- __[Sounds About Riso](https://www.soundsaboutriso.online/ \"Sounds about Riso Website\")__, [Jackie's Guide to Making a Website](https://www.zinesbyjackie.com/shop/jackies-guide-to-making-a-website-by-you--for-you \"Jackie's Guide to Making a Website - Buy\") · zine in risograph exhibition · September 2022\n- __[PRIMER2020](https://2020.primerconference.us/emerging-designer-exhibition \"PRIMER2020 Exhibition Website\")__, [Jackie's OS](https://jackieis.online/projects/jackiesos \"Jackies OS Project Page\") · poster presentation · June 2020\n- __[Computer Mouse Conference](https://www.computermouseconference.net/ \"Computer Mouse Conference site\")__, [CURSORWORLD](https://jackieis.online/projects/cursorworld \"CURSORWORLD portfolio page\") · participatory art exhibit · November 2019\n- __[PRIMER19](https://2019.primerconference.us/exhibition \"PRIMER 19 Exhibition Website\")__, [ENIAC Girlz](https://jackieis.online/projects/eniac-girlz/ \"ENIAC Girlz project page\") · poster presentation · July 2019\n- __[ NYU ITP Spring Show](https://itp.nyu.edu/shows/spring2019/ \"NYU ITP Spring Show\")__, [ENIAC Girlz](https://jackieis.online/projects/eniac-girlz/ \"ENIAC Girlz project page\") · speculative design · May 2019\n- __[NYU ITP Fall Show](https://itp.nyu.edu/shows/winter2018/ \"NYU ITP Fall Show\")__, The Body Pillow · speculative design · December 2018\n- __Museum of the Moving Image__, [a collaboration w/ my 12-year-old self](https://jackieis.online/projects/collaboration-with-12-year-old-self \"a collaboration w/ my 12-year-old self project page\") · performance · December 2018\n- __MIT Hacking Arts__, [love notes](https://jackieis.online/projects/lovenotes \"love notes project page\") · Exhibiting artist · November 2017\n\n### publication\n\n- [__In Medias Res: MIT Comparative Media Studies / Writing Magazine__](https://cmsw.mit.edu/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/In-Medias-Res-2018.pdf \"In Media Res Fall 2018 PDF\"), [Girl Meets Void](https://medium.com/@jackieleeliu/girl-meets-void-a-painted-memoir-about-being-sad-and-then-being-a-bit-less-sad-c3323c78f891 \"Girl Meets Voiid\") · Comic memoir · Fall 2018\n\n### teaching\n- __Adjunct Professor__, Core 2 Interaction Lab Instructor at The New School · Spring 2021\n- __[Neostalgic Computing](https://hyperlink.academy/courses/neostalgic-computing/63)__, Experimental Class on [hyperlink.academy](https://hyperlink.academy/) · Feb - March 2021\n\n### speaking\n- __[Harvard University WECode](https://www.harvardwecode.com/)__, Websites as Personal Storytelling talk · February 2023\n- __[Processing CCFest](https://ccfest.rocks/ccfestnyc-jan282023)__, workshop about nostalgia and learning HTML and CSS through MySpace/SpaceHey · January 2023\n- __Toronto Metropolitan University · Dare to Envision Speaker Series__, artist talk & speculative design workshop · April 2022\n- __MozFest 2021__, \"From Nostalgia to Neostalgia: Imagining Healing Visions of Computing\" · speculative design workshop · February 2021\n- __[Tech for Social Good Day](https://techforsocialgood.rocks/ \"Tech for Social Good Day site\")__, \"Dark/Net/Art: an Introduction to Self-Publishing with Tor\" · workshop w/ [Cezar Mocan](https://cezar.io \"Cezar Mocan\") · February 2020\n- __BUFU WYFY School__, \"Website Design as Personal Storytelling\" · workshop · August 2019\n\n### awards\n- __AniMIThon Winner__, [backspace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lODuMKc7QQ \"backspace Youtube link\") · animated film · May 2018\n- __[MIT Anthropology James Howe Prize](https://anthropology.mit.edu/undergraduate/howeprize \"MIT Anthropology James Howe Prize\")__, \"Clashing Colors, Blinking\nBackgrounds, Under-Construction Signs: GeoCities’ Aesthetic Legacy and the Future of Web Culture\" · essay · May 2018\n\n### education\n- __M.P.S. in Interactive Telecommunications Program__, New York University\n- __B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering__, Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}},"context":{}}
