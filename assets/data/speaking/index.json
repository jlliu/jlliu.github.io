I'm interested in nostalgia as a forward-thinking practice, and my work remembers and reimagines technology to experiment with ways of relating–with myself, with others, and with technology systems.\n\nI’m also a digital product designer with 6+ years of experience focused in STEM education and early-stage startups. My ideal future working contexts are those that value play, connection, and liberation.\n\nI’m open to artistic/design collaborations, teaching workshops and speaking about my practice, and making new connections. If this resonates with you, let's get in touch!\n\n<br>\n\n<a href=\"mailto:hi@jackieis.online\" class=\"button\" data-v-e5183918=\"\"><i class=\"fa-solid fa-envelope\"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hi@jackieis.online</a>\n\n<br>\n\n### residencies\n- __[Visual Studies Workshop Project Space Resident](https://www.vsw.org/residency/projectspace/ \"VSW Website\")__, December 2025\n- __[Welcome to My Homepage Residency](https://www.welcometomyhomepage.net/ \"Welcome to My Hompage Website\")__, December 2024\n- __[CultureHub Resident Artist](https://www.culturehub.org/ \"CultureHub website\")__, December 2023\n- __[NEW INC Year 9 Member - Art and Code Track](https://www.newinc.org/ \"NEW INC website\")__, September 2022 - June 2023\n\n### shows/exhibition\n- __[Public Works Administration](https://www.publicworksadministration.com/)__, 7 minutes in heaven · website / installation · May 2024\n- __[FREEPLAY!
