These stories often take place in media I'm nostalgic for: the early web, games, visual narratives. Constantly shifting between code, illustration, and user interface design, I merge disciplines to experiment with new modes of relating: with myself, with others, and between worlds.\n\nIn parallel, I like extending the themes in my personal work to others as creative prompts–to self-reflect, critically engage with technology, and imagine better futures. In the past, I've given talks, hosted workshops, and written zines about creating technology from a place of healing and values alignment.\n\nProfessionally, I've been a product designer in ed-tech–most recently I was the Founding Product Designer at [Schoolhouse.world](http://schoolhouse.world). This past year, I've been building my personal artistic practice as a Year 9 member in [NEW INC](https://www.newinc.org/)'s Art & Code track. I'm open to artistic collaborations, interaction design and/or creative technology work, and doing talks, workshops, and other public engagements.\n\n<br>\n\n<a href=\"mailto:hi@jackieis.online\" class=\"button\" data-v-e5183918=\"\"><i class=\"fa-solid fa-envelope\"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hi@jackieis.online</a>\n\n<br>\n\n### exhibition\n- __[NEW INC Art & Code Group Show](https://www.demo2023.org/ \"DEMO2023 Website\")__, [Chao Bing](https://jackieisonline.itch.io/chaobing \"Chao Bing\") · interactive memoir game displayed in installation · June 2023\n- __[Sounds About Riso](https://www.soundsaboutriso.online/ \"Sounds about Riso Website\")__, [Jackie's Guide to Making a Website](https://www.zinesbyjackie.com/shop/jackies-guide-to-making-a-website-by-you--for-you \"Jackie's Guide to Making a Website - Buy\") · zine in risograph exhibition · September 2022\n- __[PRIMER2020](https://2020.primerconference.us/emerging-designer-exhibition \"PRIMER2020 Exhibition Website\")__, [Jackie's OS](https://jackieis.online/projects/jackiesos \"Jackies OS Project Page\") · poster presentation · June 2020\n- __[Computer Mouse Conference](https://www.computermouseconference.net/ \"Computer Mouse Conference site\")__, [CURSORWORLD](https://jackieis.online/projects/cursorworld \"CURSORWORLD portfolio page\") · participatory art exhibit · November 2019\n- __[PRIMER19](https://2019.primerconference.us/exhibition \"PRIMER 19 Exhibition Website\")__, [ENIAC Girlz](https://jackieis.online/projects/eniac-girlz/ \"ENIAC Girlz project page\") · poster presentation · July 2019\n- __[ NYU ITP Spring Show](https://itp.nyu.edu/shows/spring2019/ \"NYU ITP Spring Show\")__, [ENIAC Girlz](https://jackieis.online/projects/eniac-girlz/ \"ENIAC Girlz project page\") · speculative design · May 2019\n- __[NYU ITP Fall Show](https://itp.nyu.edu/shows/winter2018/ \"NYU ITP Fall Show\")__, The Body Pillow · speculative design · December 2018\n- __Museum of the Moving Image__, [a collaboration w/ my 12-year-old self](https://jackieis.online/projects/collaboration-with-12-year-old-self \"a collaboration w/ my 12-year-old self project page\") · performance · December 2018\n- __MIT Hacking Arts__, [love notes](https://jackieis.online/projects/lovenotes \"love notes project page\") · Exhibiting artist · November 2017\n\n### publication\n\n- [__In Medias Res: MIT Comparative Media Studies / Writing Magazine__](https://cmsw.mit.edu/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/In-Medias-Res-2018.pdf \"In Media Res Fall 2018 PDF\"), [Girl Meets Void](https://medium.com/@jackieleeliu/girl-meets-void-a-painted-memoir-about-being-sad-and-then-being-a-bit-less-sad-c3323c78f891 \"Girl Meets Voiid\") · Comic memoir · Fall 2018\n\n### teaching\n- __Adjunct Professor__, Core 2 Interaction Lab Instructor at The New School · Spring 2021\n- __[Neostalgic Computing](https://hyperlink.academy/courses/neostalgic-computing/63)__, Experimental Class on [hyperlink.academy](https://hyperlink.academy/) · Feb - March 2021\n\n### speaking\n- __[Harvard University WECode](https://www.harvardwecode.com/)__, Websites as Personal Storytelling talk · February 2023\n- __[Processing CCFest](https://ccfest.rocks/ccfestnyc-jan282023)__, workshop about nostalgia and learning HTML and CSS through MySpace/SpaceHey · January 2023\n- __Toronto Metropolitan University · Dare to Envision Speaker Series__, artist talk & speculative design workshop · April 2022\n- __MozFest 2021__, \"From Nostalgia to Neostalgia: Imagining Healing Visions of Computing\" · speculative design workshop · February 2021\n- __[Tech for Social Good Day](https://techforsocialgood.rocks/ \"Tech for Social Good Day site\")__, \"Dark/Net/Art: an Introduction to Self-Publishing with Tor\" · workshop w/ [Cezar Mocan](https://cezar.io \"Cezar Mocan\") · February 2020\n- __BUFU WYFY School__, \"Website Design as Personal Storytelling\" · workshop · August 2019\n\n### awards\n- __AniMIThon Winner__, [backspace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lODuMKc7QQ \"backspace Youtube link\") · animated film · May 2018\n- __[MIT Anthropology James Howe Prize](https://anthropology.mit.edu/undergraduate/howeprize \"MIT Anthropology James Howe Prize\")__, \"Clashing Colors, Blinking\nBackgrounds, Under-Construction Signs: GeoCities’ Aesthetic Legacy and the Future of Web Culture\" · essay · May 2018\n\n### education\n- __M.P.S. in Interactive Telecommunications Program__, New York University\n- __B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering__, Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}},"context":{}}
