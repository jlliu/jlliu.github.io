Because this project was unfortunately deprioritized halfway through working on it, this case study focuses more on research, ideation, and low-fi prototyping. For my high-fidelity work that got shipped at Codecademy, see my writing about [redesigning onboarding](https://jackieis.online/projects/codecademy)!\n\n## The Problem\n\nMy team has long-noticed that learners tend to exit Codecademy’s Learning Environment (LE) when they get stuck in the middle of a lesson. They deduced this is because learners forget previous material and go to external resources, like Google, to find what they’re looking for.\n\n### A Case for Note Taking\n\nIn response, the Learning Experience team proposed a note taking feature where learners can easily record notes and reference them later, without leaving Codecademy. The team believed this would:\n\n#### 1. Improve knowledge retention for their learners. \nIn pedagogical research, note taking is known to increase student engagement and retention of learned material.\n\nMany Codecademy already take notes on their own. Also, note taking functions as a more active learning aid than other ways of getting help on Codecademy (e.g. pressing the “Get Solution” button).\n\n#### 2. Improve product stickiness.\nOn the business side, note taking (as a form of user-generated content) would increase user retention by allowing users to invest value into Codecademy’s platform.\n\n---\n\n## Competitive Research\n\nI started by looking at other platforms with note taking functionality.\n\n![competitive-research](//images.ctfassets.net/t9p4c9x03bar/2F6h4gB7aNP1OCijbfid1Z/2b22c36a9afd558d5c291aafa963e246/competitive-research.png)\n<div class=\"caption\">Different platforms I researched, grouped by type!</div>\n\nSome were programs specifically designed for programmers (__BoostNote__, __MedleyText__), and some were general purpose apps that involved code snippet functionality (__Notion__, __OneNote__).\n\nI also looked at __Medium__ for its “Private Notes” feature, and ed-tech platforms like __Coursera__ and __Udemy__, which allow you to bookmark notes during moments in their videos.\n\nFrom this research, I saw opportunities for a note taking feature to:\n\n- Create an easy way to capture code snippets and support syntax highlighting,\n- Integrate seamlessly in learning by associating notes with their corresponding curriculum content.\n\n## Analyzing Note Takers\n\nBefore prototyping an on-platform note taking app, I needed to understand how learners were already taking notes, off-platform!\n\nLuckily, this research was well documented; many learners share their methods on social media.\n\n![note-taking-examples](//images.ctfassets.net/t9p4c9x03bar/XBjIOCA3ttQlyS2z4Ira6/dba7351d69103556f8cf861c6fba3c7a/note-taking-examples.png)\n<div class=\"caption\">Learners sharing their processes for hand-writing notes.\n</div>\n\nI sat down with the Curriculum PM to elaborate on all potential use cases for taking notes, based on this research. We identified four main types of note taking behaviors and gave them each a name: __Cheatsheet Maker__, __Documentation Maker__, __Commentary Maker__, and __Anything-Goes__.\n\n![note-taking-types-3](//images.ctfassets.net/t9p4c9x03bar/6jHR6zHSrhBdMFXWWRVFns/e5c36ee3f89f12b2dfee42131546d496/note-taking-types-3.png)\n\nIdentifying these four types gave us insights to how, and why, the act of note taking fits into our users’ learning journeys.\n\n## Exploring Scenarios\n\nI then drafted out detailed user flows, imagining the ideal scenario for each type of note taker. Each flow documents:\n\n- What would prompt them to take a note?\n- How would they enter the note taking feature?\n- How (and where) would they reference their notes later on?\n\n![user-journies-3](//images.ctfassets.net/t9p4c9x03bar/6c6pugYr3qaUA69vvAXax8/cbb51e92dc0d1b5720db69593389b218/user-journies-3.png)\n<div class=\"caption\">A birds eye view of all the high level user journeys. The yellow line circles around the features we planned to build for V1.\n</div>\n\nDrafting all of these scenarios helped us understand what features to focus on. We decided to prioritize supporting three types of note takers: __Cheatsheet Makers__, __Documentation Makers__, and __Anything-goes__.\n\nWhile those three note taking styles could be satisfied with simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality , the __Commentary Maker__ was unlike the others due to its strong social focus.\n\n![blooms-taxonomy-650x366-1](//images.ctfassets.net/t9p4c9x03bar/22wm01RbpIKAyeHHIyc2ZK/cec37177a5ee03afa340a4c28e79b6a4/blooms-taxonomy-650x366-1.jpg)\n<div class=\"caption\">Bloom’s Taxonomy, Vanderbilt University Center for Teaching\n</div>\n\nCommentary also falls into the higher-level __analytic__ and __evaluative__ stages in learning. Meanwhile, the other types focus on retaining and applying knowledge–which were the problems we were more concerned with solving.\n\n---\n\n## Design Exploration\n\nI brainstormed several possible variants for how a note taking feature could live in Codecademy’s Learning Environment, supporting learners who might want to create cheat sheets and documentation as they follow along a lesson.\n\n### Entry Points\n\nI explored several ways a learner could enter into the note-taking feature:\n\n- An icon in the top menu\n- A button in the bottom menu, similar to the “Get Help” Button\n- And from highlighting a piece of learning content, like a code snippet.\n\n![entry-pts-2](//images.ctfassets.net/t9p4c9x03bar/1UVVJ08OXLNvdjAXh4sNma/4ce50bb05729a16f202f4bf7749ba39e/entry-pts-2.png)\n\n### Layouts\n\nI explored various layouts for notes:\n\n- A side panel\n- An adjustable, draggable popover\n- A new window/tab\n- And as an expanded overlay.\n\n![layouts-1](//images.ctfassets.net/t9p4c9x03bar/5rrIPOFPS4tGumSNg4TB3S/9e6f45771140a0438e08d31a6b726ca2/layouts-1.png)\n\n### Notes Organization\n\nI also explored several ways the notes could be organized, structurally:\n\n- By learning track (a Course or a Path)\n- By the module (a subsection of each track)\n- And finally a more freeform, user-defined method where learners create their own structure.\n\n![organizations-3](//images.ctfassets.net/t9p4c9x03bar/1eACyOKwg24fzo0Ol2a1Tu/41971469b18ebdaad881f1565b662a3a/organizations-3.png)\n\n---\n\n## Narrowing the Design\n\nAfter a few design critiques, desk chats with engineers, and check-ins with my PM, we identified key design decisions for the V1 release, and which features to prioritize later.\n\n### Deciding on a form\n\nWe settled on the draggable, __resizeable popup format__! It was important that the notes could be side-by-side with the learning content without covering up anything important —  ruling out the expanded overlay and the side panel.\n\n![general-form](//images.ctfassets.net/t9p4c9x03bar/67Dq03lB3Ev4Z9XDlSrAwz/10454b43c7ebe0b998b5bfe9ae547ce9/general-form.png)\n\nIdeally, we’d like to support the __“As a Window/Tab”__ option because it would let the learner use their monitor space as they see fit – but after conversations with engineering, we realized there would be difficult synchronization complications to build around *(what happens if multiple note tabs are open? Would they be able to sync?)*. For v1, the adjustable popup would allow a learner to take notes side-by-side while minimizing development costs.\n\n### Flexible, with just enough structure\n\nI realized that the various organizational options for notes presented a tradeoff between flexibility and structure.\n\nOriginally, the project spec established that notes would automatically be set up according to the structure of learning material, either by track or module. We knew, from our __Documentation Makers__, that many learners create guides following courses and paths as they learn – but would creating hard separations for notes between items of curriculum be too constraining?\n\nAfter a design critique, I decided to toss the track or module-based structure and go towards a __freeform format__ to avoid being too prescriptive with how we thought learners would take notes.  Organizing by track or module also presented potential complications, as the curriculum structure can often undergo changes.\n\nAt a mid-fidelity, I explored a freeform format that allows learners to create and reference whatever notes, in any track. Notes are listed chronologically, with most recent ones at the top.\n\n![chronological-2](//images.ctfassets.net/t9p4c9x03bar/iRdDTmAd3sr84DWmIoAgD/28320f0484cd1f42b1f73f8547494bcb/chronological-2.png)\n\nWhile the notes aren’t divided by track or module, we could still use the curriculum as meta-info for an organizing system! When a learner takes a note, it becomes automatically tagged with information corresponding to the relevant languages and curriculum information.\n\n![tags-being-added](//images.ctfassets.net/t9p4c9x03bar/7rbXqBVUa3OOIB3UJbEwse/107f1a0d168ce38e5b5d0222752a7263/tags-being-added.png)\n<div class=\"caption\">While the “highlighting and adding to notes” feature didn’t make it to our proposed V1, I strongly believed our V1 should at least support syntax highlighting to allow learners to add code snippets in their documentation and/or cheat sheets.\n</div>\n\nThis provides opportunity to contextually surface the notes most relevant to what they’re currently working on–without providing a hard structure.\n\n![popover-style-filter](//images.ctfassets.net/t9p4c9x03bar/4920gzbWhlOKuIFPv1tJzL/9795b81c6856f51861e7e637df1f619b/popover-style-filter.png)\n\n![popover-results-2](//images.ctfassets.net/t9p4c9x03bar/1hjxDYcQ7oPKXBrq5SPT3v/a468a2c7828768bd3d8fd26cc99733f8/popover-results-2.png)\n<div class=\"caption\">The filter provides a way to surface notes corresponding to a certain item of curriculum, in this case: the Learn Python 3 course. This can also be the default view when a learner open up Notes in a course that they’ve already written a note in.\n</div>\n\nIt also allows learners to easily search their notes by topic, language, or course name.\n\n![popover-search-1-2](//images.ctfassets.net/t9p4c9x03bar/5iULxu9Y8fDFvHLdJUytpW/d9acfe4091bcf4c2e4c7461e74ba8923/popover-search-1-2.png)\n\n## Next Steps\n\nIf we continued this project, this moment would have been a great opportunity to conduct some user tests with real learners! It would’ve been valuable to present a low-fi prototype of our V1 feature release, to:\n\n- __Reassess our assumptions__ about what users expect out of a note-taking feature\n- __Answer usability-related questions__ needed to bring the design to a higher fidelity\n\n## Reflections\n\nWhile I’m sad to not have carried this project out to fruition, I’ve learned a lot from the process! Specifically, I’m grateful for developing the confidence to push back on product specs and advocate for the user. I’ve strongly internalized that product design is not just a linear process of receiving a spec and creating mockups from it – I’m definitely challenged to see a product definition as something I have an active role in shaping.\n\nIf this gets built in the future, it’d be valuable to see how certain learning metrics (such as quiz scores, number of submits on exercises, number of days active) are impacted by whether or not learners use this note taking feature. From there, our team could validate our hypothesis that this note taking feature will increase engagement and retention.","shortDescription":"Designing a note taking feature to increase engagement and retention for Codecademy learners.","title":"Codecademy Note Taking","coverphoto":"//images.ctfassets.net/t9p4c9x03bar/64WGm9w59132l6kJiJKrHq/aaadd28fbe83f61d5adad682b5572044/codecademy_cover_photo.png","timePeriod":"Summer 2019","workType":"Product design"}}
