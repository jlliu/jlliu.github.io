Inspired by Risograph animation techniques, it offers a meditation on shame and desire as told through interactive and animated buttons, hyperlinks, inputs, and background gradients made embodied and material, with each and every moment of the website existing in printed form.\n\nThrough a laborious process of printing, scanning, and realigning over 700 images and making them interactive with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the making of the piece–in all of its effort, repetition, and imperfections–also becomes one of its core realizations.\n\nDue to browser limitations, this website is currently best viewed on desktop and Chrome or Arc browsers for the complete experience. This piece was made as part of [Welcome to My Homepage Residency](https://www.welcometomyhomepage.net/) in December 2024. Thank you additionally to [Lucky Risograph](https://luckyrisograph.press/) for the Risograph access and support.\n\n<br>\n<video autoplay loop muted controls>\n  <source   src=\"https://videos.ctfassets.net/t9p4c9x03bar/6WcRxcxVY9Ou9BMYwtVRTT/4a0a75165020ae76d8eb4106e8dea552/Part1-ezgif.com-crop-video.mov\" />\n</video>\n\n<video autoplay loop muted controls>\n  <source   src=\"https://videos.ctfassets.net/t9p4c9x03bar/7nSIgDsM43sqbbrDP0rgGT/54d0737464de6394d26b2c9347c9eb5f/part3.mov\" />\n</video>\n\n<video autoplay loop muted controls>\n  <source   src=\"https://videos.ctfassets.net/t9p4c9x03bar/UBGN4NYF8eY4S2dk2kbvB/f6bb7c08b7402e9aca2e93ba874b3dd4/part4.mov\" />\n</video>\n\n<video autoplay loop muted controls>\n  <source   src=\"https://videos.ctfassets.net/t9p4c9x03bar/5gdBS6WBZn2wo7HkHqBPSd/b7c26d29dec295ffd5d0daea1d04a8e1/part6.mov\" />\n</video>\n\n<video autoplay loop muted controls>\n  <source   src=\"https://videos.ctfassets.net/t9p4c9x03bar/2I6rnmY2yriSV3Inhj6IbI/bdc79477f319e40bf1bdba00df1a68eb/part8.mov\" />\n</video>\n\n<video autoplay loop muted controls>\n  <source   src=\"https://videos.ctfassets.net/t9p4c9x03bar/4q3MrlaQtgNcPJypzjHchY/2cc43bbbc6ef82e5eab267ed98e5d6f1/part9.mov\" />\n</video>\n\n![riso website progress 1](//images.ctfassets.net/t9p4c9x03bar/4iRsjWENUH6wSeEa17AZBm/2a4c8df7e7d7c7a8695b8b726d3e46b6/IMG_1453.jpeg)\n\n![riso website process 2](//images.ctfassets.net/t9p4c9x03bar/5BLXXdbsmWUzTmkGeswDCA/9c179a60ca3f639d5e307173706763ac/IMG_1455.jpeg)\n\n<video autoplay loop muted controls>\n  <source   src=\"https://videos.ctfassets.net/t9p4c9x03bar/1GY2yjJHgQWwBChb6sQTqg/bed9129feaa063b393b86b619c230903/Aligning.mov\" />\n</video>\n","shortDescription":"A web-based interactive narrative made fully with scanned Risograph prints.","title":"ifeelsomuchsha.me","coverphoto":"//images.ctfassets.net/t9p4c9x03bar/2IrOI7EyxpajLXFPwIhg8d/7851e04ca4ad4453e5779ae65b027700/End-_Wide.png","timePeriod":"December 2024","workType":"Net art","ctaText":"View website","ctaLink":"https://ifeelsomuchsha.me/"}}
